# textfile_parser
A simple python tool for creating SQL import statements.

The goal is to create a tool that reads through all textfiles in a directory, takes the headers, and create an SQL import/cast script based on some simple criteria. In theory, the tool is supposed to automatize the writing of imoprt/cast scripts, which can be an uncecessary repetitive task, since the same fields that get converted every time.
