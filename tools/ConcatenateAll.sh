# Should take all text files in a folder and concatenate them into one, 
# while maintaining only one header (from the first file).
# Arguments should be as follows: 
#	directory
#	extension
#	output file name

# Logic
# Open the first file, read the first line (header) and store inside a string
# Write the header into the output file (?)
# For all files:
#	Open the file, remove the header, and copy (append) the rest into the output file
